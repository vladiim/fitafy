%h5#your_content Your Content
%p When you upload or otherwise submit content to our site or service, you give FITAFY (including people we work with and our successors and assigns) a worldwide licence to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as those resulting from translations, adaptations or other changes that we make so that your content works better with our Service), communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content.
The rights that you grant in this licence are for the limited purpose of operating, promoting and improving our Service, and to develop new ones. This licence continues even if you stop using our Services.
By posting User Content, you also hereby grant to us an unrestricted, irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, fully-paid and royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense through unlimited levels of sublicensees) to use, copy, perform, display, create derivative works of, and distribute your User Content in any and all media or distribution method (now known or later developed) throughout the world.

%p Sharing Your Content In The FITAFY Site And FITAFY Services
Whenever you use the SHARE feature (or other FITAFY software or services) it's under the terms of a legal contract with FITAFY.  This contract is made up of these Terms of Service and the legal notices for the feature, software or services you use.  If you behave improperly, we may terminate our agreement with you.  This may result in your inability (and other's inability) to access content you have submitted using the SHARE feature ("Submission").

%p You must not make a Submission that includes content which you do not have a right to distribute according to this agreement.  
Marking a Submission (for example, a Workout) SHARE gives us the right (but not the obligation) to distribute the Submission (or any part of it) to any of our users, and to otherwise use the Submission (or any part of it) in any manner we choose.

%p If you don't mark a Submission SHARE, remember that anyone you share it with (and any people they share it with) can mark it SHARE, giving us the same rights we would have had if you had marked the Submission SHARE.  In other words, if you don't want to give us those rights, be careful who you share with.

%p Keep in mind that we don't have to share your Submissions with others.  We can decide to share them, share it with them for a fee, or not to share them.  Also, even if we share your Submission with others, we reserve the right to stop sharing it with them at any time.  While we plan to share your Submissions as you direct, we reserve the right not to.

%p Receiving Shared Content In The FITAFY Site And FITAFY Services
We are not responsible for the content of the information you receive using the SHARE feature.  When you use our services, you remain responsible for your conduct and actions.  Because of the way FITAFY works, although some or all of the content shared may be ours, the Workouts usually aren't ours and we may not monitor what we send to you at the request of others, although in some limited cases we might.  The information you receive using the SHARE feature may contain content that you find offensive or may contain instructions that are or could be harmful if followed.  

%p You take full responsibility for your use of the SHARE material and for any harm that it may cause to you or a third party.  

%p You will only share or republish information you receive using the SHARE feature that you have a right to share or republish in the manner you select to do so.  

%p We don't make any specific promises about the SHARE feature working properly, or in any particular manner.  We are not responsible for things that might happen to you as a consequence of your use the information you receive using the SHARE feature. 

%h5#term_and_termination_of_service Term and Termination of Service
%p These Terms and the Services may be terminated by FITAFY at any time. FITAFY shall not be liable to you or any third party in any manner for termination of the Services. In the event you should become dissatisfied with these Terms or any modifications thereof, or with the Services or the Site, your only recourse is to discontinue use of the Services, terminate your subscription, and give notice to us of these actions. Upon termination, your right to use the Services and the Site cease immediately and FITAFY shall have no obligation whatsoever to retain, forward or make available to you any uploaded exercises, exercise programs or associated data.
